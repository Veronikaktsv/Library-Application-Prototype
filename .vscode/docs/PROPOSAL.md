The web application targets librarians and users alike, functioning as an extensive book library catalog. It will have an intuitive front-end UI and a RESTful API backend. The following features will be available through the application:
- Reader Access (No Authentication Needed): Browse Books: By searching and sorting books by category, author, or title, the public can peruse the library's collection.
- Manage Books: Librarians have privileged access to carry out routine book management tasks (authentication required). Once logged in, users may choose from a set of options to add new books to the library, including their title, author, and category.
- Revise Current Books: Change details about books that are already listed in the catalog.
- Delete Books: Take books that are out of print or irrelevant and remove them from the catalog.
Preliminary Project Plan:
Planning and Setup Weeks 1-2
Specify the technical specs and user stories for the project.
Create GitHub repositories for testing and working on live projects.
Create the database schema, then install MySQL.
Create a JWT-based authentication system and REST API endpoints.
Weeks 3â€“5: Development of Backend
Create an Express.js backend to manage database connectivity and application logic.
Establish RESTful API endpoints to handle user authentication and book management.
For safe permission and authentication, integrate JWT.
Test local backend functions.
Weeks 6-7: Coding for the front end
With HTML5 and CSS3, create a front-end experience that is responsive.
Use the Alpine.js framework to implement interactive elements for a better user experience.
To get and manipulate data, interact with the backend using the Fetch API.
Check the responsiveness and usability of frontend components.
Week 8-9: Documentation and Testing
Document the application architecture, including database schema and API endpoints, in the README.md file.
Provide comprehensive documentation for developers, including setup instructions and API usage guidelines.
Conduct thorough testing of both frontend and backend components, including unit tests and integration tests.
Week 10: Deployment and Demo
Deploy the application on a free tier of a leading web application platform such as DigitalOcean.
Ensure the application is accessible and functional in a live environment.
Provide a functioning demo of the application prototype for evaluation.
